// Here, we'll be learning how to compare 2 or more different datatypes together

console.log("2" > 1);
console.log("02" > 1);

console.log(null > 0);
console.log(null == 0);
console.log(null >= 0);

console.log(undefined == 0);
console.log(undefined > 0);
console.log(undefined < 0);

// === this is known as strict check, it only only checks the value but also the datatype of the value

// We should avoid such comparisions where data of different types are converted.
