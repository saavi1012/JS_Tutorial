# Datatypes

"use strict"; // treat all JS code as newer version

In most of the JS Frameworks we avoid using semi-colon. We should also make our code readable.

## Primitive Datatypes

let name = "Shreya" // string datatype
let age = 20 // int dataype
let isLoggedIn = false // boolean datatype

number => 2^53
biginit
string => "value inside double-quotes"
boolean => true/false
null => stand-alone value, it is like an empty value
undefined => value not assigned to dataype
symnol => used to find uniqueness in a component

## Object

console.log(typeof "Shreya") ---> used to specify the type or dataype of the variable given

console.log(typeof null) ---> it comes out to be object
In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist. Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object. You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object.

console.log(typeof undefined) ---> undefined
