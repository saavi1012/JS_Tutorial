# Variables

const ---> these are constant values, fixed values that can't be changed

    Example:  const a = 10;

Now, we cannot assign any other value to a.

let & var are same, just var can be used everywhere inside the function, thus can create problems sometimes. Thus we prefer not using var because of block scope and functional scope.

Semi-colon(;) is not necessary in JS.

If we define a variable in JS but doesn't assign a value to it, the value becomes undefined.

    Example:  let value;
